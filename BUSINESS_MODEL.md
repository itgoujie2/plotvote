## 🎯 Creator Economy Model

### Core Philosophy
Users can **earn credits by creating valuable content** that attracts readers, or **purchase credits** for faster writing. This creates a sustainable growth loop:

```
Writers Create → Readers Consume → Writers Earn Credits → More Creation → More Readers
```

---

## 💎 How Writers Earn Credits

### 1. Reading Rewards (NEW - Replaces "Winning Prompts")
**Earn credits when others read your published chapters**

| Milestone | Credits Earned | Requirements |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| 10 unique readers | 1 credit | Story must have 3+ chapters |
| 50 unique readers | 5 credits | Quality score >70% |
| 100 unique readers | 12 credits | Completion rate >60% |
| 500 unique readers | 75 credits | Top 10% quality tier |
| 1,000 unique readers | 200 credits | Featured creator status |

**Economics:**
- **For Users:** Write great stories → get free credits → write more
- **For PlotVote:** More content → more readers → more signups → more revenue
- **Cost to us:** $0 until credits are used ($0.03 per credit when redeemed)

**Quality Safeguards:**
- Only count unique readers (prevent gaming)
- Must complete 60%+ of chapter (no quick exits)
- Anti-spam: Max 50 credits/month from reading rewards
- Stories need 3+ chapters to qualify (no one-shot spam)

---

### 2. Other Ways to Earn Credits

| Activity | Credits | Monthly Cap | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Welcome Bonus** | 10 credits | One-time | New user signup |
| **Referral Program** | 3 credits | 30/month | Friend makes first purchase |
| **Daily Login** | 0.5 credits | 15/month | Consecutive days = bonus |
| **Reading Rewards** | Variable | 50/month | Based on unique readers (see above) |
| **Social Sharing** | 1 credit | 5/month | Share story to Twitter/Reddit |
| **Milestones** | 5-25 credits | Varies | First story, 10 chapters, 50 chapters |

**Monthly Free Credit Potential:** ~100 credits max
- Daily login: 15 credits
- Reading rewards: 50 credits
- Referrals: 30 credits
- Social sharing: 5 credits

**Why Caps Matter:**
- Prevent abuse and gaming
- Ensure ~70% of credits are purchased (revenue sustainability)
- Keep earned credits as "bonus" not primary source

## 📊 Economic Balance Analysis

### Target Distribution
Based on creator economy platforms (YouTube, Substack, Patreon):

| User Type | % of Users | Credits Used/Month | Purchase Behavior |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Free Readers** | 70% | 0 | Never buy, just read |
| **Casual Writers** | 20% | 5-10 | Mix of earned + purchased |
| **Active Creators** | 8% | 20-50 | 50/50 earned/purchased |
| **Power Users** | 2% | 100+ | Mostly purchased, some earned |

### Revenue Impact Analysis

**Scenario: 10,000 Total Users**

#### Free Readers (7,000 users)
- **Behavior:** Only read community stories
- **Credits consumed:** 0
- **Revenue:** Ad impressions only
  - 7,000 users × 10 chapters read/month × $0.10 CPM = **$7,000/month**
- **Cost:** $0 (reading is free)

#### Casual Writers (2,000 users)
- **Credits used:** 10 credits/month average
- **Source breakdown:**
  - 4 credits earned (daily login, sharing)
  - 6 credits purchased
- **Revenue:** 2,000 × 6 credits × $0.24 = **$2,880/month**
- **Cost:** 2,000 × 10 credits × $0.03 = **-$600/month**
- **Net:** $2,280/month profit

#### Active Creators (800 users)
- **Credits used:** 30 credits/month average
- **Source breakdown:**
  - 15 credits earned (reading rewards + daily)

- **Revenue:** 800 × 15 credits × $0.24 = **$2,880/month**
- **Cost:** 800 × 30 credits × $0.03 = **-$720/month**
- **Net:** $2,160/month profit

#### Power Users (200 users)
- **Credits used:** 100 credits/month average
- **Source breakdown:**
  - 20 credits earned (max rewards)
  - 80 credits purchased
- **Revenue:** 200 × 80 credits × $0.20 = **$3,200/month**

## 🎁 Free Credit Strategy

### Philosophy
Earned credits are **engagement fuel**, not a replacement for purchases.

**Target Ratio:**
- 70% purchased credits (revenue)
- 30% earned credits (growth/engagement)

**Why This Works:**
1. **Engaged users stay longer** → Higher LTV
2. **Creators attract readers** → Organic growth
3. **Quality content wins** → Self-reinforcing quality
4. **Viral sharing** → Lower CAC

**Cost Mitigation:**
- Monthly caps prevent unlimited earning
- Quality thresholds prevent spam
- Delayed redemption (earn now, use later spreads costs)

---

## 🔄 Growth Flywheel

```
1. Writers create stories (using purchased + earned credits)
   ↓
2. Quality content attracts readers
   ↓
3. Readers sign up for free (10 free credits)
   ↓
4. Some become writers, others stay readers
   ↓
5. More readers = more credits for original writers
   ↓
6. Writers create more → cycle repeats
```

**Viral Coefficient Target:** 1.2
- Each user brings 1.2 new users (through sharing, referrals, SEO)
- Achieved through reading rewards incentivizing sharing

## 🎨 Reading Rewards Implementation

### Technical Details

**Tracking System:**
```python
class ChapterView(models.Model):
    chapter = models.ForeignKey(Chapter)
    reader = models.ForeignKey(User)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    read_percentage = models.IntegerField()  # 0-100
    is_unique = models.BooleanField(default=True)

    class Meta:
        unique_together = ('chapter', 'reader')
```

**Credit Award Logic:**
```python
def award_reading_credits(story):
    unique_readers = ChapterView.objects.filter(
        chapter__story=story,
        read_percentage__gte=60,  # Must read 60%+
        is_unique=True
    ).count()

    # Award based on milestones
    if unique_readers == 10:
        award_credits(story.author, 1, 'reading_reward')
    elif unique_readers == 50:
        award_credits(story.author, 5, 'reading_reward')
    elif unique_readers == 100:
        award_credits(story.author, 12, 'reading_reward')
    # ... etc
```

**Monthly Cap Enforcement:**
```python
def can_earn_reading_credits(user):
    current_month_earnings = CreditTransaction.objects.filter(
        user=user,
        transaction_type='earned',
        description__contains='reading reward',
        created_at__month=now().month
    ).aggregate(Sum('amount'))['amount__sum'] or 0

    return current_month_earnings < 50  # Monthly cap
```

   - Story must have 3+ chapters (no single-chapter spam)

3. **Monthly Caps**
   - Max 50 credits/month from reading rewards
   - Prevents unlimited earning
   - Ensures purchased credits remain primary revenue

4. **Fraud Detection**
   - Flag bot traffic (rapid sequential reads)
   - Ban users with suspicious read patterns
   - Require email verification to earn credits

5. **Graduated Rewards**
   - First 10 readers = 1 credit (low value for gaming)
   - Exponential rewards for higher milestones
   - Incentivizes quality over quantity

## 📞 Questions to Consider

1. **Should reading rewards be retroactive?**
   - Award credits for existing stories with readers?
   - Could be good PR ("surprise! you earned 50 credits!")

2. **Should we show earnings publicly?**
   - "This story has earned the author 127 credits"
   - Could motivate others, but also create pressure

3. **Bonus for viral stories?**
   - Extra rewards if story hits front page
   - Incentivize exceptional content

4. **Collaboration credits?**
   - If collaborative story succeeds, split credits among contributors?
   - Could encourage co-writing

---

**Bottom Line:** The creator economy model creates a sustainable, engaging platform with aligned incentives between users and PlotVote. Expected profitability: $168K/year at 10K users, scaling to $1.5M+ at 100K users.
